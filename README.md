# Smart Home System

## Overview
The Smart Home System project integrates master and slave microcontrollers to create an intelligent home automation solution. The system enables users to remotely control home appliances and monitor environmental conditions for optimal comfort and energy efficiency.

## Components
### Microcontrollers
- **Description:** Control the operation of the smart home system and manage communication between master and slave devices.
- **Models:** Specify the models or types of microcontrollers used for the master and slave devices.

### LCD Display
- **Description:** Provides visual feedback to users, displaying system status and allowing user authentication.
- **Features:** Utilizes an LCD screen for user interactions and authentication purposes.

### Sensors and Actuators
- **Description:** Interfaces with various sensors and actuators to monitor and control home appliances and environmental conditions.
- **Components:** Include sensors for temperature monitoring and actuators for controlling appliances like lights and air conditioning.

## Features
- **Appliance Control:** Allows users to remotely turn on/off home appliances such as lights, air conditioning, and television.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Continuously monitors room temperature and adjusts air conditioning settings based on user-defined thresholds.
- **User Authentication:** Utilizes the LCD display for user authentication, distinguishing between administrators and regular users for access control.

## Getting Started
### Hardware Setup
- Connect the master and slave microcontrollers along with the necessary sensors, actuators, and LCD display.
### Software Setup
1. Program the microcontrollers with the provided firmware code.
2. Configure the system to establish communication between master and slave devices.
### Integration
Ensure proper integration between master and slave devices, following the defined communication protocol.
### Power On
Power on the system and follow the LCD prompts for user authentication and system operation.

## Communication Protocol
The communication protocol between master and slave devices enables the exchange of commands and data for controlling appliances and exchanging status information.

## Dependencies
- **AVR Toolchain:** Compiler and toolchain for building AVR-based projects.
- **AVR-Libc:** C library for AVR microcontrollers.
- **LCD Library:** Library for interfacing with the LCD display.
- **Sensor and Actuator Libraries:** Libraries for interfacing with sensors and actuators.
